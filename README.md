# Microsoft Power Platform Admin Concierge

A modern, comprehensive compliance checklist and monitoring dashboard for Microsoft Power Platform administrators.

## Features

- üîç **Compliance Checklist**: Interactive checklist based on Microsoft Power Platform security and governance best practices
- üåç **Environment-Specific Tracking**: Track compliance separately for different Power Platform environments (Dev, Staging, Production)
- üìä **Modern Dashboard**: Real-time insights into your Power Platform tenant health with environment filtering
- üõ†Ô∏è **CLI Documentation**: Integrated Power Platform CLI commands and documentation
- üíæ **Persistent Backend**: Track compliance status and store historical data with audit logging
- üîê **Security Focused**: Built with Azure security best practices
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Modern UI that works on all devices

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite for development, easily configurable for production
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state
- **API**: RESTful API with proper error handling and validation

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Start development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001 (or next available port)
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000
   - Health Check: http://localhost:5000/health

> **Note**: The frontend will automatically find an available port if 3000 is in use. If port 5000 is occupied by another process, you may need to stop it first.

## Power Platform CLI Integration

The app provides comprehensive documentation and examples for Power Platform CLI commands, including:

- Environment management
- Connector analysis
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy review
- User and security role auditing
- Solution management
- Compliance reporting

## Environment-Specific Compliance Tracking

The application now supports tracking compliance separately for different Power Platform environments:

### **Environment Management**
- **Multiple Environments**: Support for Development, Staging, Production, and custom environments
- **Environment Selector**: Easy switching between environments in the UI
- **Environment-Specific Data**: All compliance items, dashboard metrics, and audit logs are filtered by environment
- **Environment CRUD**: Create, read, update, and delete environments via API

### **Environment-Filtered Views**
- **Dashboard Metrics**: Compliance scores, health metrics, and trends per environment
- **Compliance Checklist**: View and manage checklist items specific to each environment
- **Audit Logging**: All activities are tracked with environment context
- **Historical Data**: Maintain separate compliance history for each environment

### **API Endpoints**
```bash
# Environment management
GET    /api/environments                    # List all environments
POST   /api/environments                    # Create new environment
PUT    /api/environments/:id               # Update environment
DELETE /api/environments/:id               # Delete environment

# Environment-filtered data
GET    /api/compliance/categories?environment_id=dev    # Compliance items for dev
GET    /api/dashboard/overview?environment_id=staging   # Dashboard for staging
GET    /api/compliance/summary?environment_id=prod      # Summary for production
```

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=./data/compliance.db
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

### Database Schema
The application uses a SQLite database with tables for:
- **Environments**: Power Platform environments (Dev, Staging, Production, etc.)
- **Compliance Items**: Checklist items linked to specific environments
- **Compliance Categories**: Groupings for compliance items
- **Audit Logs**: Activity tracking with environment context
- **CLI Commands**: Power Platform CLI reference documentation

### Database Migration
The app includes automatic database migration to add environment support:
```bash
# Run database migration (if needed)
cd backend
node scripts/migrate-database.js
```

### Available Scripts
```bash
# Root level commands
npm run install:all    # Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
npm run dev            # Start both frontend and backend in development mode
npm run build          # Build both frontend and backend for production

# Backend specific (from /backend directory)
npm start              # Start backend server
npm run build          # Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run dev            # Start backend in development mode with auto-reload

# Frontend specific (from /frontend directory)  
npm run dev            # Start frontend development server
npm run build          # Build frontend for production
npm run preview        # Preview production build locally

# Database utilities (from /backend directory)
node scripts/migrate-database.js    # Run database migration
node scripts/add-test-data.js       # Add sample compliance items for testing
```

## Deployment

### Azure App Service (Recommended)
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy using Azure CLI or GitHub Actions
3. Configure environment variables in Azure

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t mspp-admin-concierge .

## Current Status ‚úÖ

The application is **fully functional** with the following features implemented:

### ‚úÖ **Completed Features**
- **Environment-Specific Compliance**: Track compliance separately for different Power Platform environments
- **Environment Selector**: Dropdown to switch between environments in Dashboard and Compliance views
- **Dashboard**: Real-time compliance overview, health metrics, and recent activity with environment filtering
- **Compliance Checklist**: Interactive checklist with categories, completion tracking, and notes per environment
- **CLI Reference**: Searchable Power Platform CLI documentation with copy-to-clipboard
- **Audit Logs**: Activity tracking with environment context and filtering
- **Environment Management API**: CRUD operations for managing environments
- **Backend API**: RESTful endpoints for all data operations with environment support
- **Database**: SQLite with pre-populated compliance items, environments, and CLI commands
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, accessible interface with dark/light mode support

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS (Port 3001)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + SQLite (Port 5000)
- **Database**: SQLite with automatic initialization, migrations, and sample data
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state with environment context
- **API Communication**: Axios with error handling and toast notifications

### üîß **Troubleshooting**

**Port Conflicts**: If you see port conflicts, the app will automatically find available ports:
- Frontend: Tries 3000 ‚Üí 3001 ‚Üí 3002 ‚Üí 3003, etc.
- Backend: Uses port 5000 (kill existing processes if needed)

**Backend Port 5000 Already In Use**:
```bash
# On Windows (PowerShell)
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /F /PID <process_id>

# Then restart the backend
cd backend
npm start
```

**Database Migration Issues**: If you encounter database errors, run the migration:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/migrate-database.js
```

**API Connection Issues**: Ensure both servers are running:
```bash
# Check if services are running
curl http://localhost:5000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy",...}

# Test environment API
curl http://localhost:5000/api/environments
# Should return list of environments
```

**Frontend Build Errors**: All TypeScript errors have been resolved. If you encounter issues:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build  # Should complete without errors
```

**Environment Data Not Loading**: Verify the database has environment data:
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/add-test-data.js  # Adds sample data for different environments
```
